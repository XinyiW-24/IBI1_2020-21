1. I had errors at some steps but I don’t know how to correct them. So I had to try again from the first step, which spent me a lot of time. 
2. The WLAN was poor on campus, which made it hard for us at the “git push” step.
3. I was easy to forget to add files and commit them. I need to practice more on Git.

Although this practical took me lots of time, I was more familiar with “Git” and “GitHub”, and my speed of typing increased. I learned to read the instructions in the git, ask the teacher and my friends for help, and search online to find methods to correct my error.

Question: I can’t understand the function of “git revert”. What will happen to the things we commit after we revert?
